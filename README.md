Zero-knowledge proofs are probabilistic proofs because there is some small probability (soundness 
error) that allows a cheating prover to convince the verifier of a false statement. Standard techniques used to 
decrease the soundness error to any arbitrarily small value, but with additional computation cost. The proposed 
protocol is a deterministic algorithm with bounded values (not probabilistic), hence has no soundness error and 
no additional computation cost. The proposed protocol fulfills the ZKP properties and protected against discrete 
logarithm attack and man-in-the middle attack. The proposed algorithm serves as key exchange algorithm with 
the addition to authentication services
